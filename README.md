# Latr

We want you to look forward to looking back. With Latr, you can send a message and a photo to your future self or your friends' future selves. It's easy to designate the time - minutes, hours, days or even months - with an iOS 10 date and time picker element. The receiver will then get a notification when the Latr message is ready to be seen. It's perfect for birthdays, anniversaries or just a night out. Latr is basically a time travel app.
